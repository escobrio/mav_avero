# Check first in Rviz that you defined safe trajectories
# roslaunch avero_trajectory_gen simulation.launch

# Buttons 1-6 are configured to read in polynomial segments defined in trajectory_btn{i}.yaml files. 
# Buttons 7-12 are configured to read in vertices, set maximal velocities and accelerations in cfg/avero_params.yaml

# Define segments as polynomials over time
# N: Degree of polynomial p[0] + p[1]*t + p[2]*tÂ² ...
# D: Dimension of segment
# time: Time to execute this polynomial
# coefficients: has to be a N*D matrix
